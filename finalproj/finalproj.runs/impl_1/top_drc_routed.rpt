2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net d1/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin d1/stored_button_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell d1/stored_button_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port lcd_data[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port lcd_data[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port lcd_data[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
